The BTeV experiment — for B meson TeV (teraelectronvolt) — was an experiment in high-energy particle physics designed to challenge the Standard Model explanation of CP violation, mixing and rare decays of bottom and charm quark states. The Standard Model has been the baseline particle physics theory for several decades and BTeV aimed to find out what lies beyond the Standard Model. In doing so, the BTeV results could have contributed to shed light on phenomena associated with the early universe such as why the universe is made up of matter and not anti-matter.

2025-02-17 13:07:29,495 - INFO - - Vg1_ribozyme là gì? The Vg1 ribozyme is a manganese dependent RNA enzyme or ribozyme which is the smallest ribozyme to be identified. It was identified in the 3′ UTR of Xenopus Vg1 mRNA transcripts and mouse beta-actin mRNA. This ribozyme was identified from in vitro studies that showed that the Vg1 mRNA was cleaved within the 3′ UTR in the absence of protein. Studying the Vg1 mRNA 3′UTR a manganese-dependent ribozyme was predicted to exist. This ribozyme was shown to be located adjacent to the polyadenylation site and in vitro studies showed that it catalyzes a first-order reaction where its mechanism of cleavage is similar to the manganese ribozyme present in Tetrahymena group I introns.
